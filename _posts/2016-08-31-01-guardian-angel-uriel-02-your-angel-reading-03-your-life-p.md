An Introduction to Angel Readings

Angel Cards provide you with guidance, healing and messages from your guardian angels and from the Archangels. They bring gentle and reassuring messages to help guide you in your life, and they can be comforting during times of stress or challenges that you may encounter.

Your Guardian Angels have been with you since birth. They are personal to you. Most people have around two Guardian Angels by their side. They can help you during times of difficulties and challenges, to bring you through loving and subtle messages of guidance, and they are also there with you during good times and to

work behind the scenes to support you in your life purpose and to bring in healing. They also protect your energy system and aura from any negative influences and energy.

Archangels are different from Guardian Angels as they work worldwide with anyone that needs their help, and they normally have specific roles. For example, Archangel Michael works to remove fear based thoughts and to clear negative energy, while Archangel Raphael is the angel of healing the mind, body and spirit. Archangels are omnipresent which means they can be with unlimited people at one time. This means that if you need assistance from an Archangel, you need not fear that you're taking them away from something more important.

Angels love to assist and help us as this is what they have been assigned to do, however, always remember to ask them as angels cannot normally intervene without being asked first, due to the law of free will that humans have been given. This is what makes angel card readings so effective, because the Angels are being given the space and time they need, to bring you through the guidance and messages required to help you in your life.

Like angel cards, tarot cards provide information and guidance about situations in your life, but sometimes people may be very sensitive to the images portrayed

and find them a little overwhelming. The meanings on tarot cards are not as scary as they look; for example, the death card can represent new beginnings and can be positive. However, having a reading with these images on the cards can scare some people and can put them off using them or having a reading from them.

Tarot cards can also bring through information about future events in quite a straightforward way, and this too can put people off using them. With angel cards, the messages are always positive, nurturing and healing, so there is no fear that the person having a reading is going to be told about negative events or

Angelic Plan for Abundance Page 1 of 37

worrying situations. This is why angel cards can be more suitable for sensitive individuals, because they are gentler and provide a softer and more loving way of conveying messages, whether past, present or future.

The reason for the difference is because angel cards are working with the angelic realms and angels always work with love and light. They work on a high spiritual vibration that always encourages, supports and motivates people in their life. Angels are pure and loving beings who will never give negative information. Their job is to inspire, heal and enthuse people with positive energy.

When I work with angel cards, I tune into the energy of the Angels and intuitively

choose cards from the pack. I look at the card and notice any images, feelings and information that are coming through. I then bring through the intuitive messages that the Angels wish to express for you.

Guardian Angel Uriel

"(4) In him was life, \[a\] and the life was the light of men. (5) The light shines in the darkness, and the darkness has not overcome it."

John 1 1:4-5

Archangel Uriel is referred to as Deus Lucem in Latin, which translates to God's Light.

One of the many angels referenced in the Book of Enoch, Archangel Uriel was the guide that lead Enoch on his journey of revelations about the heavenly beings. His ability to guide and enlighten makes him one of the most sought after Archangels for those who are searching for answers.

With a name that means "The light of God", one may think that his heavenly role would be easy to define. However, it is important to consider the question of

whether or not you can truly describe what light is, or let alone hold it. Archangel Uriel is a being of mystery, yet, he is also considered to the Archangel of intuition and subtle guidance. When he answers prayers, it is not always clear to recognize his work. This is because the answers he provides often come as sudden thoughts, epiphanies, or ideas that just seem to slip into your mind. In a way, he illuminates your mind with his unfathomable insight and guides you to the solution of any problem you may be facing.

Angelic Plan for Abundance Page 2 of 37

For someone like you, being born with a special bond to the light of God can be one of your greatest boons, and the source of your inquisitive and intuitive characteristics. You may have felt all your life that some source of knowledge resided within you that sought to be expanded and sits as the source of answers and guidance when you needed it. For this you can give thanks to your Guardian Archangel Uriel.

Your Angel Reading

Your Angel Reading incorporates the guidance of the Angels to help inspire and

motivate you in your life. I have picked the Angel Cards with intuitive guidance from the Angels, to bring you through the messages that you may need to hear right now. We will go into detail about each card throughout the reading, and the intuitive messages that have been received about each one.

For your Angel Reading I was guided to draw 10 cards for you today. 5 cards represent your Life Purpose, and 5 cards represent your Character. Take note that the number 10 is also a very significant Angel number, as it represents new beginnings, motivation, achievement and progress. It reminds us of how we create our own progress with the intentions we put out into the world, creating a very symbolic meaning within the whole reading. The number 10 also signifies a message for you to have faith in the guidance that your Angels are bringing through for you on a daily basis, and it encourages you to step forward with optimism and a positive attitude.

For your Life Purpose reading, each card has a title to explain that area in more depth.

 Card 1 covers the present moment and where you currently are in your life in relation to your life purpose. It is about what action steps you may need to take right now to move you forward.

*  Card 2 represents how self-reflection can help you to gain insights into what your next steps are for your life purpose and how to work with the Angels to achieve this.
*  Card 3 is about the next week ahead and any areas or action steps that you may need to work on for your life purpose in the upcoming week.
*  Card 4 is about the next 3 weeks ahead for you and how you are going to see your life purpose develop over this time.
*  Card 5 brings you in guidance about the final outcome, and how things are going to turn out in the future with your life purpose.

Moving on to the second part of the reading, it gives you information about yourself and your Character as a person. It also offers guidance to help you in all areas of your life. Each card covers areas that you may need to put focus and work into right now, including different aspects of your personality and how they affect your life. Each card includes intuitive guidance from the Angels and insight into how you can work on your own self to improve your life in positive and empowering ways. Unlike your Life Purpose reading, these do not have titles, due to the unique nature of the individual self.

I am truly excited to help you discover abundance with the help of the Angels. Let us begin your reading now.

Angelic Plan for Abundance Page 4 of 37

Your Life Purpose

The first 5 cards I drew for you all revolve around your purpose in life and its important role in helping you manifest abundance. This reading provides a snapshot of your life in the present moment and where you currently stand, as well as guidance on self-reflection to further unlock your life purpose with the help of the Angels. It then guides you on what to do and expect in the week ahead and the next weeks to come, and then finally, it gives you insight on the bigger, brighter picture that is waiting for you.

The Present Moment

Card 1 -- Archangel Jophiel: (Patience)

The message that Jophiel brings in for you today is about having patience for your dreams to blossom. The angels wish to let you know that they are working behind the scenes to help your life purpose manifest. It may sometimes feel as if you're stuck or you may be unsure about which way to turn and what steps to take next, but Jophiel brings you the message that all is truly in divine order.

Angelic Plan for Abundance Page 5 of 37

As you send out positive thoughts and turn your thoughts to connecting with your life purpose, this will plant the seeds of growth for your life purpose to grow. Even if you're unsure of exactly what your life purpose is at the moment, just through having the intention to embrace your life purpose and focusing your thoughts upon this, you will find that ideas and inspirations start coming to you over the next few weeks.

Archangel Jophiel is the angel of creativity and turning negative thoughts into positive, and she will assist you with tapping into your inner creativity, so that you can discover your soul's true purpose and direction. As you allow yourself time to

connect within, you will find that the inspirations and ideas that come to you will start to form into action steps for your life purpose.

She says for you not to rush into situations right now, but to take it a step at a time. Just as a gardener waits for the seeds he has planted to push through the surface, so must you give your seeds of intention the energy they need. At the same time, have patience and trust that they are growing and reaching towards the surface, and soon you will start seeing your desires manifesting into form.

Remember that everything is in divine order and that sometimes, situations need to be put into place behind the scenes by the Angels, so that the right actions happen at the right time. Everything is in synchronization, and as you follow your inner guidance, and the guidance of the angels, you will find that opportunities and events will unfold naturally within the right time, to provide you with the situations needed to embrace your life purpose.

While you connect with your inner guidance with the help of Archangel Jophiel, this can also give you the opportunity for self reflection. You will find that you start recognizing passions and desires that you may not have known were there. As you start to recognize your inner passions, it is important to follow any guidance you receive.

Angelic Plan for Abundance Page 6 of 37

Self-Reflection

Card 2 -- Archangel Haniel (Passion)

Archangel Haniel brings you the message about following the inner passion that you discover through self reflection. Very often in life, it can be easy to get caught up in what you feel you 'should' be doing, or you may feel pressure on you right now to conform to what you've been told through past conditioning.

Haniel wants to let you know that it's okay to follow your passion; in fact, following your passion will help you to embrace your life purpose! Release any negative thoughts or pressures that you may be putting on yourself, that are not

fully aligned with what you feel passionate about.

Your passion is a great indicator of your life purpose. What is it you love to do? What is it you do, where you lose track of time because you're enjoying it so much? What did you always love to do as a child? Some of these questions are great pointers into what your life purpose is, and they are a great reflection tool for connecting with your inner spirit.

Angelic Plan for Abundance Page 7 of 37

Archangel Haniel wishes to let you know that you have unique talents and gifts. Never compare yourself to others as you have your own unique way. As you connect within, start to recognize what brings you the most happiness and joy. Even if your passion may seem unconventional or out of the ordinary, Haniel wishes to let you know that this is okay! As you express your unique self and allow your soul to shine, you will start finding that over the next few weeks, situations will start to fall into place and that you will see events occurring that open up opportunities, so that you can take action on your life purpose. Haniel also asks you to have confidence in your abilities. Have faith in who you are and in your gifts.

Archangel Haniel can help you with understanding your emotions and in following your heart and passions. Ask her every evening before going to sleep to infuse your dreams with ideas and inspirations that are aligned with your life purpose, and she will happily assist to bring this through in your dreams. You will soon find that out of nowhere, you have an inner knowing of what your next steps are and what action you need to take.

She can also help you with bringing through healing at night time, so that any emotional blocks which are preventing you from moving forward with your life purpose can be gently dissolved.

As you work with Archangel Haniel, you will find that you gain a deeper understand of who you truly are, and this will assist you with finding out what you truly desire within your life. You have the answers within your spirit and Haniel will enable you to tap into these and take positive steps towards fulfilling your inner dreams and desires that are aligned with your soul and life purpose.

The Angels also bring you a message about how your inner dreams and desires may be related to expanding your knowledge and guiding others in their life. Archangel Haniel can also assist with developing your psychic gifts, so that you can gain a deeper understanding of the energy around you, and this in turn will

help you to recognize and follow signs relating to your life purpose.

The Week Ahead

Card 3 -- Archangel Zadkiel (Teaching and Learning)

As you work with discovering your psychic gifts and developing a deeper understanding of who you truly are, you may find that teaching and learning are areas that you feel drawn towards. Archangel Zadkiel brings you a message about how this is important to you right now.

You may be doing some kind of studying, such as attending a course or reading a book that you find inspiring, and all of this effort is going to help you in teaching and guiding others in the future. You have a natural way of guiding other people,

and teaching doesn't necessarily always mean in the traditional sense of teaching in a classroom, but it can also be the people you touch in everyday life and the conversations that you have.

Your life purpose isn't just about having a career, it is also the actions you are guided to do each and every day of your life. Even the moments you have with strangers, who may approach you for help, or the conversations you may have with family and friends, may all be ways that you are fulfilling your life purpose.

Angelic Plan for Abundance Page 9 of 37

Do realize that your life purpose is already manifesting for you, right now and right in this moment!

By expressing your authentic self, you are already fulfilling your purpose. As you continue to express yourself in this way, you will find that you will naturally start to see ways in which you can bring all areas of your life into alignment with your life purpose, and create a career where you are doing this full time. You have the ability, power, and strength within you to create the life you desire, and Zadkiel teaches you the power of being able to express yourself in a way that is true to who you are.

He will also help you to improve your memory, so that whilst you are in the process of learning, he will support you with remembering the details of what you learn and easily be able to recall it in the future. This will then enable you to guide others with the information and knowledge that you have learnt. Anytime before reading, attending workshops or studying, ask Archangel Zadkiel to help you with absorbing the information you are learning, and he will happily assist you with this. He is the Archangel of knowledge and has access to any knowledge or questions that you may seek, therefore during times of helping others, ask for him to bring you through the knowledge and understanding that you need to help that person fully. Anything that you wish to know, just ask, and Zadkiel will be happy to provide you with the answers, including subject areas that are related to your life purpose.

As you start to work with Zadkiel you may notice how situations start to move forward in positive ways. The knowledge that you receive from him is going to give you the boost and inspiration to take the next steps within your purpose, and to start putting your thoughts into action over the next 3 weeks.

Angelic Plan for Abundance Page 10 of 37

The Next 3 Weeks

Card 4 -- Archangel Ariel (Spread Your Wings!)

Through the energy that Zadkiel has brought you over the last week, you may at this point find that situations are starting to fall into place for you. As mentioned previously in the first card, it takes patience to allow dreams and desires to manifest, but as you do this in the present, over the following weeks you're going to start seeing the results of your efforts.

Archangel Ariel encourages you to take action when you feel ready, and you will know when you're ready as you'll feel a strong sense of intuition within you.

When this time arrives, she also encourages you to take the steps that are necessary, and this may come in the form of opportunities which present themselves in front of you.

You may find that someone phones you out of the blue and invites you to a workshop, or that you're invited to a social event that connects you with like minded people who can support you on your life purpose. You may even see an event or opportunity advertised that feels right for you and resonates somewhere deeply within.

Angelic Plan for Abundance Page 11 of 37

Sometimes it's important to step outside of your comfort zone and embrace new experiences to progress, as this can help you to meet new people and be in new situations which can open up positive occurrences. Over the next few weeks you may find that there will be an area you feel drawn towards, and this is going to enhance your life purpose. You may also find that this is connected with teaching and learning in some way, and you may end up teaching people about subjects which you feel very passionate about.

Archangel Ariel is the angel of magic, manifesting, strength, courage, confidence, nature and focus. Over the next 3 weeks, you'll find that many of these areas will

be brought into your awareness, particularly where your confidence and courage is concerned, and you may find that you start feeling more confident in your abilities and it's as if you may feel a sense of someone standing behind you, supporting you to take the next steps. This will be Archangel Ariel.

Stay focused on what you desire and the Angels will bring you in the blessings, manifestations and magic needed to make the next 3 weeks a positive and exciting journey towards your life purpose. These changes that you make through these 3 weeks are going to be the springboard to creating a positive and happy outcome in relation to your life purpose.

The Final Outcome

Card 5 -- Archangel Sandalphon (Victory)

The hard work and dedication that you put in during the 3 weeks working with Archangel Ariel will pay off in the future. This card comes with a message from Archangel Sandalphon, and it is one of happy times ahead and a positive future!

Archangel Sandalphon wishes to let you know that your prayers have been heard and are in the process of being answered, and you are on the right pathway to manifesting your desires. This card brings you the message of victory and success, to let you know that you are moving towards your soul's desires. You will

also find that you will always be provided with the right amount of financial support and resources needed to embrace your life purpose fully. Try not to ask where or when this is going to happen, just have faith in a positive outcome and trust in the process as it unfolds for you.

As you recognize your inner guidance and act upon it, you will find that situations flow for you in a wonderful way. This card also shows how your hard efforts and dedication will pay off in the end, and represents how you're moving towards manifesting your desired life purpose. Situations behind the scenes will ensure

Angelic Plan for Abundance Page 13 of 37

that the right people come to you at the right time to allow your life purpose to flourish.

Archangel Sandalphon brings you reassurance that your future is taken care of and that you are on the right pathway. Spend time regularly listening to relaxing music and connecting with your guardian angels, as they will bring you daily guidance and energy to help you fulfill your goals. Visualize and picture the final outcome and how you wish for your life purpose to be. Feel these feelings and experience them like they've already happened. This sends out a message to the Universe of your desires, and the Angels will support you with manifesting these.

Archangel Sandalphon was actually a man on earth, and because of this he is able to understand and empathize with human life. He can help you connect with your spiritual gifts, including your healing abilities and your abilities to manifest.

Sandalphon is known as the archangel of answering prayers, so ask him either out loud or in your mind what your desires are, and he can assist in speeding up the universal flow to bring you in these blessings.

Archangel Sandalphon is also the angel of music, so you may find that when you connect with him, you hear a song or music that resonates deeply with you. This may be music you hear on the radio or in a random circumstance, and very often if it touches your soul, this is his way of bringing you through a message.

You may notice that many of the Archangels work with you over the coming weeks, as just by having your intention on them, they will be attracted into your life and will support you in your life purpose.

Overall, these cards have brought you positive guidance from the Angels about your life purpose and they confirm to you that you are on the right track. Carry on with a positive attitude and visualizing the outcome you desire, for it will start

manifesting very soon for you. The Angels are always by your side and are opening up doors of opportunity for you, and now is the time for you to embrace your gifts and talents to make the world a better place!

Next, we will cover who you are as a person and bring through angelic guidance to help you in all areas of your life.

Your Character Analysis

For this reading, I drew another 5 cards to take a clearer look at your character as a person. Who you really are and what you really want are very strong influencers in your journey to discover your purpose and live in abundance, and with the help of the Angels, I will help you gain deeper insight into yourself.

Card 1 -- Archangel Jeremiel (Overcoming Difficulties)

Archangel Jeremiel brings you a message about how you've built up strength

through the situations you've encountered in the past. Right now is a time for you to reflect on your life situation and where you are, to recognize the power and strength that is now within you.

You may find that the past hasn't always been easy and that at times you've been in some very negative situations and may have had to deal with people who didn't always treat you with the respect you deserved. The message now is that these difficulties are being overcome, and that you are moving on to more positive times ahead.

Angelic Plan for Abundance Page 15 of 37

The Angels also wish for you to know that very often, challenges in life are brought in to help you spiritually grow and learn from what you experience, and that this is part of the human experience and soul development. The Angels wish to let you know how well you've done in overcoming your difficulties, and your Guardian Angels reassure you that they were always by your side through the challenges you encountered in the past.

You are now rising above the negativity that was once in your life, and you may even find that you don't connect with the same people you used to. This is because as you change and evolve through your experiences, your spiritual

vibration is also rising. And because of this, people who are quite negative minded and don't have the same positive outlook on life as you start to drift away. This can seem daunting at first, but it is part of your spiritual development and it is enabling your life to open up to allowing positive people into your life, who are going to love and support you, rather than bring you down.

Archangel Jeremiel can help you with reviewing your life and recognizing where any parts need changing. He will bring you the motivation you need to make necessary changes that move you towards a happier and more fulfilling life, and he will support you in overcoming any negativity that may be around.

He can also bring you insight and guidance to help you move your life forward, releasing any feelings of being stuck. Although sometimes, being stuck may also be caused by blocked emotions in your aura and energy system.

Angelic Plan for Abundance Page 16 of 37

Card 2 -- Archangel Raphael (Breathe)

Archangel Raphael can help you to release blocks in your aura and energy system that may be preventing you from moving forward in your life. He is the angel of healing, and he brings you a message to focus on self healing and pay more attention to the needs of your spirit. Very often in life, you may find that you're rushing around a lot and are caught up in the daily routine. Perhaps you haven't been giving your spirit the attention and space it desires.

Archangel Raphael asks that you take at least 5 minutes out of your day, each and every day, to slow down and to take several deep breaths, to help you connect within and align with your soul. Through the power of breathing, you will

find that you can release old emotions and patterns of behavior.

You may find that life's stresses and a busy mind have prevented you from fully connecting within, and you may also be pressuring yourself about different situations that are happening right now. Release this pressure and go within, know that in truth everything is in divine order.

Archangel Raphael brings you the message that the energy of worry can be turned around and used positively. Instead of worrying about situations that are

Angelic Plan for Abundance Page 17 of 37

around you, start to focus on solutions and how you can solve problems. If a situation is out of your control, release the worry as this may be lowering your energy levels. If there is nothing you can do to resolve it, it is wasting your energy. Instead send healing prayers and positive thoughts to the situation and ask for the Angels to bring a positive resolution. You will find that as you do this, instead of worrying, the situation will resolve itself and that you feel lighter and more vibrant within yourself.

Archangel Raphael can bring you through healing if you have suppressed emotions, or if you have an imbalance within your mind, body, or spirit. Whilst in the shower, ask for Archangel Raphael to cleanse your mind, body aura, and spirit

with his emerald green healing energy. As you do this daily, you will notice how your energy levels start to improve and how you have more passion and inspiration for the day ahead. This is a great way to bring daily nurturing into your life and establishing it as part of your daily routine in taking care of yourself and your own needs.

Angelic Plan for Abundance Page 18 of 37

Card 3 -- Archangel Gabriel (Nurture)

This card confirms what was mentioned previously, about nurturing yourself and bringing this into your daily life, as it is a sign of how important this is for you right now.

This card can also represent how children are important for you in your life right now, or that you need to nurture and take care of your own inner child. Experiences from the past can mean that you have unresolved emotions, because of the way you've been treated or because of situations that have happened throughout your life. As you connect with your inner child, you will find that you start to release these emotions and this will allow you to be more

aligned with the present moment and where you are now in your life.

The past can keep a person held back in the memories, emotions, and perceptions that happened at that time, and can prevent a person from moving forward in the present moment. Archangel Gabriel can help to heal past experiences, particularly experiences in childhood or where you felt vulnerable and unloved. She will bring in healing and will help you with emotional release, therefore freeing you to embrace your true and authentic self in the present moment.

Angelic Plan for Abundance Page 19 of 37

Nurturing yourself is also important, especially if you have a busy lifestyle. Take time out to relax, go for walks and do anything that provides you with that much needed self nurturing energy, as this will bring you spiritual insights and healing that you may need.

Archangel Gabriel can also assist you with creativity, writing and leadership skills so that you can move forward positively and productively in your life.

Archangel Gabriel can also support you with any issues associated with parenting and this could also be a sign that children are or are soon to become important

within your life.

Archangel Gabriel also brings you the message to have more fun in your life. It may be that recently, you've been so consumed with other daily issues or situations that you've forgotten how to enjoy yourself! Laugh and have fun, as this is what life is about. Try to surround yourself with people who make you feel good about yourself and who bring you positive energy, laughter, and joy.

Joy is one of the most positive emotions and it's important that you start to have this as a priority in your life. Daily life can be quite stressful at times, so embracing the emotion of joy can really give you the energy and inspiration needed to put you in a good place physically, mentally, and spiritually.

Angelic Plan for Abundance Page 20 of 37

Card 4 -- Archangel Metatron (Prioritize)

Prioritizing your emotional needs, such as joy, can enable you to be become more focused on your pathway ahead. Archangel Metatron also encourages you to prioritize other areas of your life, such as becoming more organized and motivated, which in turn will lead to a sense of joy.

It may be that recently, you've found yourself in situations a bit overwhelming or that you have a lot to achieve in a short space of time. Metatron asks that you focus on your highest priorities, so that you are not overwhelming yourself with too much to complete, and gain the enjoyment from each moment instead of thinking about the past or the future.

You may be at a turning point in your life now where you're trying to decide what your next steps are and what direction you should be heading to within different areas of your life. Metatron wants you to ask yourself this question --- What do YOU really want? Not what do think you should do.

Very often, it is easy to become consumed with ideas about how you should live your life based on the expectations of society, friends, work colleagues, family or situations, and this can bring you away from living a life based on the desires of

Angelic Plan for Abundance Page 21 of 37

your own soul. Metatron will help to bring to light what it is your soul longs for and he will help to bring you the motivation and spiritual understandings to take action upon this.

Archangel Metatron is also great for helping you to clear your chakras of any negative energy. Through your life you may have accumulated negative energy from others, or you may have developed negative self beliefs that are holding you back in your life. Visualize Archangel Metatron passing sacred geometric shapes through the top of your head, and passing them all the way through and down your body until they come out your feet. This will help to clear your energy system, and in turn will enable you to become more focused and clear about your

true desires.  
Archangel Metatron also brings you a message about how you have the ability to connect with your Angels. He asks that you pay attention to the messages you are receiving, as you have a natural spiritual ability to connect with the messages that are coming through for you, and this is a gift you've had since you were a child. To listen to their messages find a quiet space and ask for Archangel Metatron to assist you in receiving the messages with clarity and understanding. And if you ever have any worries about connecting with the Angels because of fear-based thoughts, ask for the protection of the Angels, particularly Archangel Michael.

Angelic Plan for Abundance Page 22 of 37

Card 5 -- Archangel Michael (You Are Safe)

If you ever feel slightly concerned about spiritual subjects and connecting with different realms, know that Archangel Michael will always keep you safe, and this card confirms it. Ask for his assistance with any area of your life that you may feel is out of balance or where there may be negative people around.

You may find that a work situation or negative people sometimes make you feel drained of energy and unable to focus fully on being positive. If any situation like this occurs again, ask for Archangel Michael to clear the negativity away and protect you with his beautiful blue energy. You will then find that their negative energy does not have the same effect upon you as it used to.

Archangel Michael is also assisting you right now with bringing a positive home environment. Ask for him to regularly cleanse and clear the energy in your home so that it can be a positive and nurturing place for you. He can also clear the energy at work or any place that you visit, so that the highest and greatest of good is served.

Archangel Michael also wishes to help you right now with releasing fear-based thoughts that you may have, and he asks that you be willing to release these

Angelic Plan for Abundance Page 23 of 37

thoughts. Set your intention to release them, and then ask Archangel Michael to lift them away. He will ensure that your energy is high vibrational and that all fears and negativity are lifted away from your mind, body, and aura.

There is also a message for you about being a light worker. Archangel Michael works very close with light workers to help them fulfill their purpose and achieve their goals. Signs of being a light worker may include wanting to help others, a feeling of a higher purpose and feeling passionate about an area that helps people, animals or the environment. You may have already received signs about this, perhaps through seeing feathers in unusual places or right in the centre of your pathway, hearing music that deeply resonates with you, seeing coins in

unusual places, or a book falling off the shelf at just the right time. You may also notice reoccurring number sequences or wildlife that comes very close to you. These are all signs from the angels that symbolize your spiritual gifts and to let you know that you are on a very special pathway: the pathway of a light worker and making the world a better place.

The signs are also confirmation for you that the Angels are very close by your side, listening to what you say and bringing you through the love, healing and guidance that you may need right now.

Have faith that the Angels are working very closely with you. This reading represents just how open you are becoming to receiving their messages. It also highlights your very unique and special spiritual gifts that you can continue to develop with the help and assistance of the Angels.

I am excited to see you move forward in abundance. Below is a 21-day action plan to enable you to do this, and to help you work closely with the Archangels to enhance all areas of your life.

Your 21 Day Action Plan  
Connect With the Angels & Create the Life That You Desire

Here is a 21 day action plan for you to follow, which also includes a daily affirmation for you to use. It is best to use this affirmation in the morning and before bedtime, and facing a mirror to say this can improve its effectiveness.

The aim of this action plan is to assist you in deepening your connection with the angels, therefore creating the healing you need in your life and manifesting the

life you desire. You may wish to use a journal or notebook throughout the 21 days to record your thoughts and feelings.

Day 1

"I embrace my creativity and tap into my inner spirit, I am ready now to move forward positively in my life."

For today, write down what you wish to achieve in your life. Make a list of 5 short term goals that you would like to achieve over the next 21 days, 5 goals you would like to achieve this year and 5 longer term goals that you would like to achieve over the next 5 years. This is a great way to start your 21 day journey, as it is a good reflection point for you to refer back to. Before you start, find a place where you won't be disturbed and perhaps play some relaxing music, then ask for Archangel Jophiel to support you with the process. She will assist you by bringing you through creativity and help you to see situations in a positive way. Ask her to assist you in completing the 21 day action plan, in a relaxed way and at a time and place that suits you.

Before going to sleep: Ask for Archangel Jophiel to bring you through healing in your sleep and to assist you with the next 21 days of the action plan.

Day 2

"My life is filled with loving people and positive situations. I invite positive opportunities into my life which are aligned with my highest good."

Angelic Plan for Abundance Page 25 of 37

For today, reflect on where you are right now in your life, using your journal to write down some notes. Split the page into two different columns, one with the heading 'what I love about my life' and one with 'what I want to improve'. Spend some time reflecting upon this and write down any thoughts that come to you. Ask for the assistance of Archangel Haniel as she will bring you through the ability to understand your emotions on a deeper level. On the next page, write any more thoughts, feelings or emotions that arise from doing this exercise.

Before going to sleep: Ask for Archangel Haniel to lift away any emotions that have been released during today's exercise. Ask her to bring you through messages and inspiration in your dream state, as to what your next steps are in

your life. Remember to keep your journal by the side of your bed throughout the 21 days so that you can record any dreams that you have.

Day 3

"Thank you for all the blessings in my life! I know and trust that wonderful blessings are always manifesting in my life."

For today, spend some time focusing on what you love doing. Read a passage or chapter from a book that inspires and motivates you, or watch an inspirational video that makes you feel good. After you have done this, write in your journal what you love in your life and what you're grateful for, listing as many things as you like. You can also list simple blessings, such as having clean water, clothes, and warmth. Afterwards, thank the Universe for the many blessings you have and make a commitment to always focus on what you do have, rather than what you're lacking. Through doing this you communicate to the Universe that you wish for more of the positive blessings to manifest your life!

Before going to sleep: Ask for Archangel Zadkiel to work with you during your sleep state to help improve your memory and to release any negativity that you

may be holding within your mind. Remember to keep your journal with a pen by your bed in case you need to record your dreams.

Day 4

"I thank the Angels and the Universe for providing me with everything I need. I know I am always taken care of and have faith that I always receive what I need to fulfill my life purpose."

Angelic Plan for Abundance Page 26 of 37

For today, ask for the presence of Archangel Ariel to help you with manifesting what you desire. Start by relaxing and listening to some calming music and visualize how you wish for your life to be. Feel and experience each moment as if it has already happened; take in and absorb those wonderful emotions. After you have experienced this way of life, ask for Archangel Ariel to infuse the vision with her magic and manifestation energy. Visualize this experience floating into the air and being guided up by the Angels into the Universe, so that it can manifest into form. Write in your diary as if it has already occurred, for example "I have gratitude that I now have a thriving healing practice" or "I have gratitude that I now have the home I desire".

Before going to sleep: Ask Archangel Ariel to bring you messages in your dream state of what action steps you need to take to achieve your desires and dreams.

Day 5

"I release all negative people and situations from my life. My life is now a reflection of the love and peace that this within my soul."

For today, focus on self-healing and recognizing any blocks that are preventing you from reaching full success. To do this, ask for the assistance of Archangel Michael. Listen to some calming music and ask for Archangel Michael to cut all negative energy attachments between yourself and other people or situations. He will only cut the negative connections while keeping all positive connections intact. You may see this as a cord passing from yourself to other people or even past situations. Once these cords have been cut, you should feel lighter. Ask for Archangel Michael to clear away any residual energy that is left and visualize yourself being cleansed by a healing blue waterfall, washing away all negativity from your mind, body, and aura. You may wish to record this meditation and your experience in your journal.

Before going to sleep: Ask for Archangel Michael to clear away all fear-based thoughts, and ask him to bring you confidence and motivation about your next steps.

Angelic Plan for Abundance Page 27 of 37

Day 6

"I am one with all that is, I am an expression of the divinity of the creator and I express myself fully and without compromise."

For today, try to spend some time in nature, even if this is just a local walk. As you do this focus on the moment you're experiencing, rather than any concerns or worries you have. Take in the sounds, the smells and the beautiful sights that surround you and really be in the moment. If your thoughts start to wander to life concerns, gently shift your focus back on the present moment and what is immediately in your awareness. Watch the birds and the flowers and take some

deep breaths. As you breathe in, visualize the life force energy around you cleansing your whole mind, body, and soul, and as you breathe out, allow any stress or concerns to be released. If you can, try to repeat this walk as many times as you can during the remainder of the action plan. As you spend time in nature, ask for a sign or message from your Guardian Angels to be brought through. You may notice a sign in different forms, or you may receive a soft message in your mind. Record any thoughts, feelings or experiences in your journal.

Before going to sleep: Visualize yourself in nature, and feel the energy of the plants, trees and wildlife, healing you from your head all the way down to your feet. Ask for Archangel Jophiel to fill your mind with beautiful thoughts and to bring you inspirations as you sleep.

Day 7

"I now take control and ownership of my life, I feel motivated and positive about embracing new and exciting opportunities."

For today, reflect back on your goals that you wrote on day 1 in your journal and

on your thoughts you wrote on day 2 about where you are right now in your life. Think how you can take one action step today, to move you towards where you want to be. This can be something really small, such as making a commitment to meditate more, or it can be something bigger such as enrolling on a course. Now is the time for you to take positive action, even smaller actions can lead to bigger opportunities.

Angelic Plan for Abundance Page 28 of 37

Before going to sleep: Ask for Archangel Jeremiel to bring motivation in the form of ideas and action steps. Ask for him to assist you during positive times of change, so that you can fully connect with your life purpose

Day 8

"I give myself time to connect within and recognize the peace and calmness of my spirit. I know that I can go to this place anytime I desire to receive healing and serenity."

Today, spend at least 10 minutes relaxing and going into meditation. Ask for the

assistance of Sandalphon to bring calmness to your mind and spirit. Listen to some calming music and allow any thoughts or distractions to drift away from your mind. Keep your focus on the centre of your forehead (the place of your third eye chakra) and each time any thoughts come in about life, gently bring your focus back to this area. As you practice this for 10 minutes, you may start to become aware of your inner soul. Ask Archangel Sandalphon to assist you in bringing to the surface any desires of your soul that have not yet been recognized. These messages may come to you in the form of feelings, emotions, pictures in your third eye, sounds, music or visions. Record this experience in your journal and take some time out to fully relax and enjoy the energy that the angels bring in for you today.

Before going to sleep: Ask for Archangel Sandalphon to bring calmness to your soul. Ask for him to answer your prayers and to bring the truth of your spirit through during your dreams.

Day 9

"Thank you angels for assisting me in releasing any negativity that I may be holding in my mind, body, spirit or aura. My chakras are balanced and in harmony

with my soul."

For today, ask for the assistance of Archangel Metatron and work with him to release any negative emotions that you may be holding onto. Visualize Archangel Metatron passing his healing energy (this is often in the form of geometric shapes) through the top of your head and all the way down, through the centre of your being, through your shoulders, torso, stomach, pelvic area, thighs, legs and out through your feet. Visualize all negative energy being cleansed away. After this cleansing, take it easy for the rest of the day and nurture yourself. Drink

Angelic Plan for Abundance Page 29 of 37

plenty of water to allow the cleansing process to take full effect upon your energy system. Write any experiences you've had in your journal. Tomorrow, we will also be working with Archangel Metatron for organizing and motivation.

Before going to sleep: Ask for Archangel Metatron to bring your chakras into balance as you sleep.

Day 10

"I am organized in all areas of my life and I have a clear mind about my next steps.

I take action when required to embrace my life purpose."

For today, the focus is upon organization and motivation. Think about any areas of your life right now that need organizing, and make a list in your journal of immediate actions you can take to bring this into balance. Having your paperwork, home and future events organized can create good energy in your life, and this can also help you to become more focused on your life purpose. Once you have written your list, ask for Archangel Metatron to help you implement this into your life one step at a time. You will find that by writing this down, it makes it more manageable, number each action in order of priority.

Before going to sleep: Ask for Archangel Metatron to work with you during your sleep, to bring ways to become more organized. Ask for him to bring you in the motivation you need to achieve this, and know and trust that this will truly happen as you focus your will upon this.

Day 11

"I allow full expression of my soul and embrace my inner child with love and joy. I release all pains from the past and I give myself permission to be in the joy of

each moment."

For today, spend some time with your inner child. Take yourself out on an outing that taps into your inner creative and fun side! This could also mean doing creative arts or something that you used to enjoy as a child. This may involve spending time with children around you, or spending time on your own doing something that is fun and inspiring. Allow yourself to fully express this part of yourself and know that as you do so, it is very healing for your soul. If you struggle tapping into this side of yourself, ask for Archangel Gabriel to bring you the

Angelic Plan for Abundance Page 30 of 37

understanding and creativity to allow this to happen. Once you have done this, note down any thoughts or feelings you experienced, if you found you had blocks write these down too. As your blocks are good indicators of imbalances that you need to work on.

Before going to sleep: Ask for Archangel Gabriel to come into your dreams and assist you with connecting with your inner child. Visualize seeing yourself as a child, and embrace the child with love. Hug the child and tell the child anything that you may need to have heard when you were this age. You will find that the child image of you will be at the age when you needed the most healing. Ask for Archangel Gabriel to release any emotions that arise and embrace the happiness

and joy that this child brings to your soul.

Day 12

"I release all fear of opening up my spiritual senses and understand that it is a natural part of my energy system. My chakras are fully balanced and I trust in my abilities."

For today, spend some time focusing on your spiritual gifts. Start by asking Archangel Raziel to assist you with this as he is great for helping people to understand spiritual information and with helping to develop psychic abilities. Before you go into a situation, bring attention to the centre of your forehead, your third eye. See if you can tune into who you are going to see first. If the phone rings, before looking, tune in to who is calling. If you're watching sports games, see if you can visualize what the scores are going to be. These are all good ways for developing your psychic senses. Meditation is also a great way and with continued practice you will find that your psychic senses develop and that you are able to tap into the energy that is around you. These are exercises you can practice in daily life throughout the whole of the action plan; you will be surprised at just how well they develop as you progress. Keeping a track of your progress in

your journal is a good idea, as this helps you to reflect on your development.

Before going to sleep: Ask for Archangel Raziel to awaken your psychic senses. Ask for the protection of Archangel Michael also, so that you do not become disturbed during your sleep. As you sleep Archangel Raziel can bring you through the necessary steps needed to develop your senses and you may also find that you journey with him to learn new information and knowledge during the sleep state. Remember to record all your experiences in your journal.

Day 13

Today the focus is on bringing light into situations and progressing in a positive way. Over the last 12 days you have done some inner work to release emotions and connect with your true self. Today, Archangel Uriel is working with you to help you focus on your next steps and the direction you're heading in your life. If you're still unsure about what this is, Archangel Uriel will happily assist you, as he helps to bring light into any situation. For today ask Archangel Uriel to bring you through signs and messages of your direction. Notice any signs you receive and any messages that you hear, these may come directly from him or they could

come through physical means, such as overhearing a conversation that makes sense to you, hearing something on the radio or seeing something on the TV at the right time. Spend some time today to connect with his energy, ask for him to light your next steps and to bring you through new ideas about your direction. Write down 3 numbers in your journal today, number 1, 2 and 3\. Ask for Archangel Uriel to bring you through a message in a clear way. Then next to number 1 write the first message, thought, word, picture or anything else that comes to mind. Repeat this for all 3 numbers and trust in the process. Archangel Uriel is a very good communicator and so this method should work for you.

If you struggle to receive any messages today, ask for them to be brought in during your sleep tonight and remember to record this in your journal.

Day 14

"Peace surrounds me, my family and my friends. All is well in my world."

Raguel is the Archangel who is assisting you today. Today is about creating justice and fairness in your life. It is about creating the right environment to allow your dreams to blossom, and to do this you need to focus on healing any areas of

your physical environment which are out of balance. Ask for Archangel Raguel to come into any areas of your life where there are arguments or disharmony; he is fantastic for bringing resolutions. Visualize his beautiful pale blue energy surrounding any people or places that need healing. Record any healing you do in your journal so that you can reflect back on them in the future and monitor progress of the situation you're healing. You can repeat this daily if you wish until the situation is resolved.

Angelic Plan for Abundance Page 32 of 37

Before going to sleep: Thank the Angels for bringing harmony and balance into all areas of your life and the life of other people. Ask for the Angels to be with everyone in your friends and families circle who need healing right know, remember to include yourself as well.

Day 15

"I trust in the process of life and I know that my future is taken care of in wonderful ways! I embrace my inner confidence and take the next steps with courage in my heart."

Today we are working with Archangel Michael to reflect on the messages you received from Archangel Uriel on day 13\. Archangel Michael can bring you the confidence and courage to move forward and follow this guidance. Have a look at the messages Archangel Uriel brought you through and reflect on how you can implement these into your life. These could well be linked with your life purpose, so have a think about how you can now start to put this into motion. Ask for Archangel Michael to assist you with your life purpose and you will start to feel and know the next steps to take. Archangel Michael and Archangel Uriel work wonderful together as Archangel Uriel can light your next step and Archangel Michael gives you the courage to take that step! Spend 10 minutes today meditating with their energy, and record any inspirations, thoughts or feelings you receive.

Before going to sleep: Thank Archangel Michael and Archangel Uriel for their assistance today. Ask for them to continue guiding you in your sleep, to bring you through messages that they may not have been able to bring to your conscious mind.

Day 16

"I am wonderful in all I do, I am loved and I love. I love and appreciate who I am as a person and I attract balanced and healthy relationships into my life."

Today we work with Archangel Chamuel who can help assist you with relationships. You may find that relationships have been a block in the past for you moving forward, so today write a list of the different roles that you play in your life. For example you may write words such as Mother, Sister, Wife, Employee or any other roles that you have in your life within different relationships and situations. List the responsibilities that you have under each

Angelic Plan for Abundance Page 33 of 37

role, so for example you may as a Mother be giving, loving, nurturing, providing food etc. Then write the word 'Me'. Under the title 'Me' write down who you are as a person away from these roles. This is a great tool for understanding your own uniqueness and to bring self awareness. Write this in your journal and then add any more words under the heading 'Me' as they come to you, and you will probably find they do as you go through different forms of self development.

Before going to sleep: Ask for Archangel Chamuel to bring harmony and balance into all your relationships. Visualize a pink light surrounding the ones you love. Visualize yourself in this beautiful pink light, connected in a happy and healthy relationship.

Day 17

"I now step onto my spiritual pathway I trust in the process. I have faith that everything is manifesting for me at the right time and at the right pace."

Today we are also working with Archangel Chamuel again as he is also the Archangel relating to life purpose. You may already have a strong feeling about what your life purpose is and you may have already taken action upon this over the last 16 days of the action plan. Write 3 lists of what you feel passionate about in your life and what you love doing, what you wanted to do as a child and what activities or interests you do, where time passes so fast you lose track! Compare this to your ideas on what you've discovered about your life purpose and see how it compares. You may find that what you love doing connects with your feelings regarding life purpose. This is also a great exercise to complete if you're still unsure about what your life purpose is. Record any thoughts and feelings about this in your journal so you can look back on your reflections.

Before going to sleep: Ask for Archangel Chamuel to bring you through any more information, ideas or inspirations needed to help your life purpose manifest

even more brilliantly.

Day 18

"Thank you Archangel Uriel for helping me to reach my goals easily and with joy. I continue to reach the goals I set for myself and know that I am divinely guided."

Angelic Plan for Abundance Page 34 of 37

Today we're going to look back at the goals that you created on day one. Ask for the assistance of Archangel Uriel as you focus upon this. Have you managed to complete any of your goals? If not, do not worry as you've worked on allot during the last 17 days. Perhaps rewrite your goals as your insights and perceptions may have changed since day 1\. You may have even found your 5 year goals have changed! So for today rewrite your list of goals in necessary, as this will set you up well to continue with taking action after you have completed the 21 days. This is optional depending on how you've got on with your last goals. Write a list of 5 short term goals, 5 goals you would like to achieve this year and 5 longer term goals that you would like to achieve over the next 5 years.

Before going to sleep: Ask for Archangel Uriel to bring you through ideas and inspirations on how you can achieve all of your goals. Ask for him to bless your life with the opportunities and situations to help these to fully manifest for you, and thank him for his assistance.

Day 19

"I thank the Angels for their heavenly assistance and for the guidance they continue to give me. I know that their love continuously surround me now and always"

Today is a day of celebration as you have reached day 19, and you've done so well! Throughout the last 18 days you have connected with many of the different Archangels and their energy. Today focus upon which Archangel you found you resonated with the most and spend some time connecting with the energy of this angel. Spend 10 minutes listening to some calming music and visualize being in a beautiful crystal palace. Visualize standing in the middle of this crystal palace and ask for the presence of one or more Archangel. Notice the different feelings, emotions, visions or sensations you feel as you connect with this energy. Ask for the Archangel that stands in front of you, to bring you through a message to

carry you forward in your life. This may be any of the Archangels that appear before you and this is the Angel that can help you with your next steps. Record in your journal any messages you receive and any experiences you have, as this is wonderful guidance for the next steps along your journey.

Before going to sleep: You may wish to ask for the energy of the Archangel that you connected with today during the meditation, to surround you. Ask for healing to take place and for their energy to bring you what you need right now.

Angelic Plan for Abundance Page 35 of 37

Day 20

"I am now free to embrace a life of happiness and joy! I express myself easily and with love in my heart"

Today we work with Archangel Jeremiel as he is the angel to help assist you with change. As you have progressed on this journey, you may have released allot of old emotions and connected deeper to your true self. Now you have cleared any barriers to your success and you are ready to embrace the positive changes that are coming in for you, to help you enjoy a happy, abundant and positive life!

Today ask for the energy of Archangel Jeremiel to surround you, as you are now in a place where your life will be moving forward and this often incorporates some form of change. Change can take a while to get used to, but know that this is for your highest and greatest of good and it is taking you to more positive place, aligned with the vibration of your soul and your life purpose. Today's action is to surround yourself with the healing light of Archangel Jeremiel for 10 minutes (or more if you wish) and ask for him to bring you in any insights about your progression and your life right now. Remember to write down any message you receive from him, as these will often be insights into what is coming up for you soon. You are now free to move forward knowing that nothing is going to hold you back and that you can truly express your wonderful and authentic self!

Before going to sleep: Ask Archangel Jeremiel to take you on a journey of self discovery. Visualize travelling with him, protected by his beautiful purple healing energy. Write down any inspirations or insights that come to you during the night.

Day 21

Today is the last day, and the Angels thank you for working with them for 21 days! Celebrate your achievements and how far you've come. Look back at your

journal and think about how you've developed from day 1\. Write a list of your feelings and experiences during your journey, and record your thoughts about how you feel you've developed. Throughout these 21 days, you have worked very closely with the Angels, and you can still continue this and incorporate them into your everyday life. After you have done this, take yourself on a trip to celebrate or do something you love and enjoy, because you truly deserve it.

Before going to sleep: Thank the Archangels for their assistance over the last 21 days and ask for them to be in your life each and every day. Ask Archangel

Angelic Plan for Abundance Page 36 of 37

Michael to bring you the motivation and confidence to now continue on this journey with love and faith in your heart. This is just the beginning of amazing blessings in your life!

Conclusion

Now that you have come to the end of your 21 days, remember that the Angels are always with you and they're just waiting for you to ask for their assistance. They will always assist you with any area of your life. Always remember how

close they truly are to your heart.

If you ever need inspiration or guidance, take a look back through your reading and you may find that the right words reach you at the right time. You can also take any of the action steps from the 21 days and repeat them at anytime you feel necessary, perhaps pick some of your favorites, and work with the ones that resonate the most with you on a regular basis.

I am wishing you much positivity with your life and your journey to abundance, and sending you Angel blessings.

Your Angel Messenger,
